import React from 'react';

interface QuantityCellProps {
  quantity: number;
}

//  QuantityCell recieves the quantity value as a prop and decides what to display or do with that value.

// logic to implement:
// basic function : show the quantity value in the cell.

// conditional formatting:
// change how the quantity will be showed based on it's value.
// so if the quantity if high, i could highlight in green
// if the quantity is low, i could highlight in red.
